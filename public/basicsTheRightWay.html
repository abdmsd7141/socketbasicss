     on a web page, allowing a client to establish a connection with a Socket.IO server and
      participate in real-time communication with other connected clients or the server itself.-->

    //and a Socket.IO server that is listening on http://localhost:8000.
    /*
    The io() function is provided by the Socket.IO client-side library and
     it creates a new Socket.IO client instance. 
     The argument passed to the function specifies the URL of the Socket.IO server to connect to. 
     In this case, the URL is http://localhost:8000, which means the Socket.IO server is running on 
     the same machine as the client, on port 8000.

    Once the connection is established, the socket variable holds a reference to the Socket.IO client instance 
    and can be used to send and receive messages to and from the server.
     For example, you can use the socket.emit() method to send data to the server
      and the socket.on() method to receive data from the server.
